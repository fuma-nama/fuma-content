## Hello World

I love Next.js <Hide>Joulev</Hide>, and my side projects as well.

this is good!

```js
import { withContent } from "@fuma-content/next";

export default withContent({
  content: {
    files: ["./content/**/*.md"],
    outputDir: "./.content",
  },
});
```

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "content": ["./.content/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

```js
import entry from "content";
import { source } from "fuma-content";

export const documents = source(entry, {});
```
