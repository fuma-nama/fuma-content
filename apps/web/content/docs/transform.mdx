## Runtime Transformation

You can transform data at runtime. It is useful for dynamic properties that is fast to compute, or if you want to modify based on the generated entry.

```ts
import { docs } from "content/docs";

export const transformedDocs = docs.transform((id, entry) => [
  id,
  {
    ...entry,
    customProperty: "hello world",
  },
]);
```

## Build-time Transformation

For collections that are compiled during build-time, they can also expose hooks to add custom properties.

This depends on the collection type, as it is not mandatory to expose build-time hooks for collections.

For example, with MDX collection:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "fuma-content/config";
import { mdxCollection } from "fuma-content/collections/mdx";
import { z } from "zod";

const docs = mdxCollection({
  dir: "content",
  options: () => ({
    // you can transform AST with remark/rehype plugins:
    remarkPlugins: [myPlugin],
  }),
});

// or add custom property to module export:
docs.vfile.pipe((vfile) => {
  vfile.data["mdx-export"] ??= [];
  vfile.data["mdx-export"].push({
    name: "customProperty",
    value: "hello world",
  });
  return vfile;
});
```
