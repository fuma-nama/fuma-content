title: CLI Tool
---

Despite the built-in Next.js integration, you can use the CLI tool to work with other frameworks.

```bash
pnpm i @fuma-content/cli
```

Create the configuration file.

```js title="fs.config.js"
export default {
  files: ["./content/**/*"],
};
```

Run watch command.

```bash
pnpm fuma-content watch
```
