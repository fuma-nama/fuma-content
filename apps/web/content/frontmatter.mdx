Fuma Content has built-in support for frontmatter validation using Zod.

## Usage

Install `zod`.

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm i zod
```

Pass your schema through the `schema` option.

```js
import entry from "content";
import { z } from "zod";
import { document } from "fuma-content";

export const documents = document(entry, {
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

Fuma Content loves type safety, the `info` property in each document will be inferred to the schema type you have passed.
