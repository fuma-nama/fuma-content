## Overview

### Collection

A collection acts as the storage layer of a specific type of content.

For instance, a collection of MDX files in file system, or documents in remote database.

### Collection handler

Collection implements handler for each feature, you can imagine it as **traits** or **characteristics** of a collection.

Handler contains options, publicly exposed to plugins for further processing.

### Plugin

A plugin configures the necessary settings to handle different collections, they have access to low-level APIs like bundler configurations.

For instance, a plugin that reads the `pdf` handler of a PDF file collection, then configure a loader on bundler to support compiling PDF files.

This is analogous to **cellular differentiation**, your body reads the type of cell to perform different operations.
