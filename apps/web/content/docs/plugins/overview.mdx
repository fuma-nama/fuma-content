## Creating Plugin

You can create a plugin with:

```ts
import type { Plugin } from "fuma-content";

export default function myPlugin(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: "custom:my-plugin",
    config() {
      const { cwd } = this.core.getOptions();
      console.log(cwd);
    },
    // you can define different hooks
    async collection(collection) {
      console.log(collection);
    },
  };
}
```

### Hook Order

When triggering event on multiple plugins, event hooks are called according to its order in `plugins` array. Order is strictly preserved.
