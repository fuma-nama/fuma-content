## Conventions

**Only applies to internal codebase.**

### Path

When naming a variable `path`, you should specify whether it is a relative or an absolute path.

- `path` - Not allowed
- `relativePath`, `absolutePath` - Allowed

When naming a variable `file`, it must be an absolute path to a file.

For absolute paths, backward slashes are allowed.
For relative paths, only forward slashes are allowed.
