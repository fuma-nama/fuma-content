## Why Fuma Content?

I wrote this library as [Contentlayer has not yet added their official support for Next.js 14](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/575).

You may consider `fuma-content` as an alternative to Contentlayer.

By design, Fuma Content is also:

- Light: It is a light layer over `@mdx-js/mdx`, comparing to a bundler, it is incredibly fast.
- Type-safe: Support frontmatter validation with **Zod**.
- App Router Ready: Write **server components** in a MDX file.
- All in Typescript: Flexible, Powerful, and **Confidence**.
- Nice MDX support: Transform relative imports into absolute paths, allowing you to import **anything** supported by your loader.

### Additional

I love Next.js, <Hide>Joulev</Hide>, and my side projects as well.
