## Hello World

Fuma Content is the library for handling content.

### Install

Use the Next.js integration.

```bash
pnpm i fuma-content @fuma-content/next
```

### Usage

Add this to your Next.js configuration.

It must be `next.config.mjs` as `fuma-content` is a ESM module

```js
import { withContent } from "@fuma-content/next";

export default withContent({
  content: {
    files: ["./content/**/*"],
    outputDir: "./.content",
  },
});
```

Add import alias to your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "content": ["./.content/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Import generated documents and json files.

```js
import entry from "content";
import { document, json } from "fuma-content";

export const documents = document(entry);

// You may use JSON files for organizing documents, for example, sorting pages.
export const jsons = json(entry);
```

### Type-safe Frontmatter

Install `zod`:

```
pnpm i zod
```

Pass your schema through the `schema` option.

```js
import entry from "content";
import { z } from "zod";
import { document } from "fuma-content";

export const documents = document(entry, {
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

### Why Fuma Content?

I wrote this library as [Contentlayer has not yet added their official support for Next.js 14](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/575).

You may consider `fuma-content` as an alternative to Contentlayer.

By design, Fuma Content is also:

- Light: It is a light layer over `@mdx-js/mdx`, comparing to a bundler, it is incredibly fast.
- Type-safe: Support frontmatter validation with **Zod**.
- App Router Ready: Write **server components** in a MDX file.
- All in Typescript: Flexible, Powerful, and **Confidence**.
- Nice MDX support: Transform relative imports into absolute paths, allowing you to import **anything** supported by your loader.

### Additional

I love Next.js, <Hide>Joulev</Hide>, and my side projects as well.
