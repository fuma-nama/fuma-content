## Overview

Fuma Content uses a simple system of **Collections** & **Plugins**.

### Collection

Collection is the object to process, it exposes **hooks** to connect with bundlers & framework and provide functionalities.

Collection types can inherit from each other, for example, in a **MDX Collection**:

- `vfile` hook to customise MDX file compilation.
- inherited from File Collection:
  - `onServer` hook to configure hot reload.
  - `getFiles()`, `hasFile()` for file system APIs.

### Plugin

Plugins can attach custom configurations to collections, and hook into different events.

They have more control over collections, such as access to low-level APIs, bundler configurations, acting as the middle layer between collections and low-level APIs.
